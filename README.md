# plasticity-and-network-dynamics
This repository contains two independent research projects conducted during my MSc in Neurosciences at LMU Munich. Both projects investigate mechanisms of neural plasticity and network dynamics, focusing on cortical microcircuit structure and synaptic plasticity-induced oscillatory behavior.
