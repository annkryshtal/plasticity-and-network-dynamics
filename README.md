# plasticity-and-network-dynamics
This repository contains two independent research projects conducted during my MSc in Neurosciences at LMU Munich. Both projects investigate mechanisms of neural plasticity and network dynamics, focusing on cortical microcircuit structure and synaptic plasticity-induced oscillatory behavior.

These studies were carried out under the supervision of leading researchers at ISTA and LMU.

## üìÅ Project 1: STDP and Gamma Oscillations

**Institution**: Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU)  
**Supervisor**: Dr. Caroline Geisler  
**Title**: *STDP-Induced Plasticity Effects on Hippocampal Gamma Oscillations*

This project investigated how spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) influences oscillatory activity in hippocampal networks. I implemented a network model to examine how plasticity mechanisms can affect the emergence and stability of gamma rhythms.

**Keywords**: STDP, gamma oscillations, hippocampus, plasticity, network simulations

## üìÅ Project 2: Structure of Visual Microcircuits

**Institution**: Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA)  
**Supervisor**: Prof. Tim Vogels  
**Title**: *Exploring the Structure of Visual Microcircuits in Cortical Neural Networks*

This project focused on analyzing and modeling synaptic connectivity patterns in visual cortical networks. By studying experimentally constrained microcircuits, I explored how anatomical connectivity may shape functional computations in the cortex.

**Keywords**: cortical microcircuits, synaptic connectivity, network topology, visual cortex, computational modeling
